    "# **Fake News Detection Using DEEP LEARNING**  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Author:** Saksham Pathak, MSc AI & ML (2024-26)  \n",
    "**Under the Guidance of:** Mr. Sandeep Srivastava, Professor of MLOps  \n",
    "\n",
    "### **Problem Statement**  \n",
    "The rise of misinformation poses a significant challenge in today's digital era. Fake news spreads rapidly, influencing public opinion and decision-making. A robust fake news detection system is essential to ensure the credibility of information.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### **Project Overview**  \n",
    "This project leverages a **Simple Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)** to classify news articles as **fake** or **real**. The dataset, sourced from Kaggle, consists of labeled news articles. Key preprocessing steps include **tokenization, padding, and text vectorization**, followed by training a Simple RNN model for classification.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### **Key Objectives**  \n",
    "- Develop an **efficient fake news detection system** using deep learning.  \n",
    "- Improve model accuracy through **data preprocessing and hyperparameter tuning**.  \n",
    "- Deploy a web application for real-time news verification.  \n",

    "### **Challenges in Fake News Detection**  \n",
    "The proliferation of misinformation poses a significant challenge in today's digital landscape. Fake news spreads rapidly across social media, influencing public perception, political discourse, and societal stability. Detecting fake news is complex due to several factors:  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Ambiguity & Bias**: Some articles contain a mix of factual and misleading information, making classification difficult.  \n",
    "- **Contextual Understanding**: Traditional models struggle with sarcasm, hyperbole, and politically biased narratives.  \n",
    "- **Evolving Misinformation**: Fake news constantly evolves, requiring adaptable detection techniques.  \n",
    "- **Dataset Limitations**: Many datasets are imbalanced or lack linguistic diversity, impacting model generalization.  \n",
    "\n",
    "To address these challenges, we aim to develop a robust **deep learning-based fake news detection model** that can accurately classify news articles.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Dataset Selection & Justification**  \n",
    "For this project, we selected the **Kaggle Fake News Dataset**, which consists of two separate files:  \n",
    "- **Fake.csv** – News articles labeled as **fake**.  \n",
    "- **True.csv** – News articles labeled as **real**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "This dataset was chosen due to the following advantages:  \n",
    "✅ **Balanced Representation**: Equal distribution of fake and real news samples.  \n",
    "✅ **Labeled Data**: Clearly annotated data facilitates supervised learning.  \n",
    "✅ **Sufficient Size**: The dataset includes over 40,000 articles, enabling robust model training.  \n",
    "✅ **Diverse Sources**: Articles come from various publishers, improving model generalization.  \n",
    "\n",
    "By leveraging this dataset, we aim to train an efficient **Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)** capable of distinguishing between real and fake news articles based on textual content.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Dataset Overview**  \n",
    "The dataset comprises news articles with the following key attributes:  \n",
    "\n",
    "| Feature | Description |\n",
    "|---------|------------|\n",
    "| **Text** | Full content of the news article |\n",
    "| **Label** | Classification label (0: Fake, 1: Real) |\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Class Distribution**  \n",
    "- **Total Samples**: ~44,000 articles  \n",
    "- **Fake News Samples**: ~22,000  \n",
    "- **Real News Samples**: ~22,000  \n",
